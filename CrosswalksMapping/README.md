Activities & output for exploring terminological synchronization, semantic harmonization, crosswalks and mappings between vocabularies (or other knowledge organization systems, such as taxonomies, ontologies, etc.) of the given topic areas (in this case, astro/outer space related).
The current method is a manual (not automated) approach.

Overarching questions:
- What are the similarities and differences between two given knowledge organization systems / semantic systems / ... ('vocabularies' for short)?
- Can a given set of vocabularies, or set (or pair) of terms from distinct vocabularies, be mapped, synchonized or harmonized?
- What is synchronization and harmonization? 
- What are the ethical aspeects?
- To what degree are a given set of vocabularies, or set of term, mapped? What type of mappings? (e.g., string, syntax, semantics, assumptions, leaf-node only, degree of abstraction/subclassificaiton, etc.)
